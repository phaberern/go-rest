# go-rest && DOCKER
dockerized go rest api 

## What 
This repo provides a starting point for a rest api written in golang. It loosely follows clean architecture.

## Why
I have been programming with go for about a year now (since 05012018) on a team that is responsible for a med-high number of applications. Most of these apps are cloud native. All of them have dependencies that are in/out of our control.

How do we test distributed systems? 

How can we spin up a local testing environment without worrying about env variables or secrets? I hate asking people for these things. 

## How

Docker for the win. This is not an all encompasing solution but it does let us control what we know.
